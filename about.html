                    <h2>Who are Lesbians Aloud</h2>
                            <p>The Management Committee, the networks they are connected with, and the people this project is aimed at 
                            are predominantly older Lesbians from across the UK. In the absence of physical lesbian spaces to meet-up in,  
                            the main source of lesbian networking seems to be a myriad of facebook groups which come and go.<br><br>
                            During the covid lockdown our secretary was involved in holding fortnightly zoom meetings for Lesbians, 
                            referred to as LUL - Lesbians under Lockdown. It appeared that the majority of attendees were older Lesbians, 
                            many living alone and not in support bubbles. The negative impacts of isolation were prevalent within this group. <br><br>
                            At each session women took turns to share their story, along with encouragement to read their favourite poems, 
                            sing a song or share other personal arts projects. It became obvious that there was a dearth of specifically 
                            lesbian-themed books, art, poetry, music, film etc. 
                            </p>

                        <p>Lesbians Aloud aims to carry on the work started during the covid lockdowns, bringing lesbians 
                        together through theatre, poetry, singing and music, in order to create a community they can belong 
                        to and enjoy and create the arts together.<br><br>
                        To do this, it is the intention of lesbians aloud to create a feeling of community that can then be 
                        used to work together to create and perform a variety of events, developing the ideas and the stories 
                        of the that join the community, in turn, bringing in more lesbians to our community.<br><br>

                        <p>We know that older Lesbians suffer more isolation than our straight sisters and that many of us have additional 
                            barriers to full participation, such as access needs arising from financial difficulties, disability, deafness, 
                            a high incidence of neurodiversity and the rural isolation already mentioned.<br><br> 
                            Re-establishing in real life meet ups and connections is challenging and many women feel even more vulnerable and 
                            cautious about going to what few public events there were than before Covid. The demographic of older Lesbians 
                            also experiences a higher-than-average intersectionality with mental health impacts, deafness, disability and 
                            neurodivergence reflected throughout our community.<br><br>
                            Knowing this, we were confident that we would be meeting a need for our community if we put a project together 
                            to create material about our lives, using the arts, and encouraging women to gather to celebrate and perform 
                            together.
